Welcome!   
My name is Zih-Sing (Louie) Fu, a graduate student researcher in Digital Circuits and Systems Lab at National Taiwan University (NTU).
I am now working on the project of digital VLSI design under the supervision of Prof. Chia-Hsiang Yang.
I received my B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2019 and working on my M.S. degree in electronics engineering from NTU GIEE. My research interests include VLSI design and computer architecture for AI/ML applications or digital signal processing.
